Troubleshooting Problems:
=========================
1) Sometimes movement gestures aren't being registered from the radial keyboard. 
On some occasions it works fine until I release it, then it might not work the
next time.
	Solution: When the user begins a movement gesture, they must not begin
that movement on top of any of the radial buttons.  The buttons mask the motion
event and as such, any methods from the onTouchEvent for the view won't get
called.  In short, the user must make sure they begin their touch gesture on the 
view NOT a button (except for the select button, this was disabled for this 
reason).
