Update on Regions and Edit Text:

-Made it easier to visualize where the active regions for the menus are.
	~Visual regions in the AToZActivity class can be toggled off by commenting out the drawOverAZRegions function located in the addEditTextRegion method
	~Visual regions in the RadialActivity can be toggled off by commenting out the drawOverExteriorRegions method located in the makeExteriorRegions function
	~Uncomment the line butt.setAlpha(0.0f) in the makeRadialRegions method to make transparent but visible buttons appear
	*There seems to be a glitch when drawing regions in the radial and edit text activities.  Due to the transparent overlay, I think the regions are still invisible.  I believe that even though they are invisible, they are correctly matched to the buttons now.

-The help button (blue question mark) in the EditTextActivity is currently acting as a back button to return to the AToZActivity

-Slide functionality now exists for the EditText activity.  Since a lot of this activity is requires you to manipulate a string, I might suggest setting the userString variable in the Vars class to a default value on startup.
