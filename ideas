Ideas for COMP580 Project:
==========================
1) Grouping the alphabet characters by their use frequency in conversations would
probably help a lot.  This is intended to give the user letters that they would
most likely use in accordance with natural speech patterns in English.

2) You should probably be able to jump between radial keyboards from within another keyboard.  Pressing and releasing to navigate through a menu just to press to get to another menu is probably too many actions for simple typing.
